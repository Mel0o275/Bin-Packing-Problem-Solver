The Bin Packing Problem is a classic optimisation problem in which the objective is to efficiently
pack a set of items into a minimum number of bins or containers. Each item has a specific size, and the bins have
a limited capacity. The goal is to find an arrangement that minimises the number of bins used. This problem has
real-world applications in logistics, resource allocation, and space optimisation
